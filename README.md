# SQL and Tableau Project
Covid-19 data exploration in SQL and visualization process in Tableau Public.

Data in this project downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and it belongs to 2020 and 2021 years.

For the visualization process, I'm going to use the data that I've filtered in SQL, turn them into excel format and import them into Tableau Public. The link to Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oz.sec/viz/Covid-19DashboardFrom20-21/Dashboard1
