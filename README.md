# SQL and Tableau Project
Covid-19 data exploration in SQL and visualization process in Tableau Public.

Data in this project was downloaded from *https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths* and it belongs to 2020 and 2021 years.

**CovidDeaths.xlsx** is the raw data that I gathered from above link.

The following 4 files are used in Tableau, and belong to SQL prompts that's been made before the visualization process in excel format:
**Tableau Table 1.xlsx**
**Tableau Table 2.xlsx**
**Tableau Table 3.xlsx**
**Tableau Table 4.xlsx**

**SQL Query for Tableau.sql** is the SQL file, it has the necessary information on each prompt and respective explanations.


For the visualization process, I'm going to use the data that I've filtered in SQL, turn them into excel format and import them into Tableau Public. The link to Tableau Dashboard: *https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oz.sec/viz/Covid-19DashboardFrom20-21/Dashboard1*
